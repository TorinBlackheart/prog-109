      <strong>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </strong>

      <strong>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Something I would recomment to future students is it's not bad to look at other peoples work and change it to your needs and to use outside sources like W3Schools to help you understand the topic.
